The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request- URI. The set of changes is represented in a format
called a "patch document" identified by a media type. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending on the patch document 
type (whether it can logically modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.

The difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is reflected in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource identified by the Request-URI. In a PUT request,
the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced. With PATCH,
however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.
The PATCH method affects the resource identified by the Request-URI, and it also MAY have side effects on other resources; i.e., new resources may be created, or existing ones modified,
by the application of a PATCH.
